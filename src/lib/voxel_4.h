/**
 * voxel space class for tetra-octa grid.
 *
 * This builds on top of the brick grid as this grid is implemented
 * using the normal bricks. So this class can use many of the brick
 * functions it just has to ensure certain alignments.
 *
 * The emulation is working like this: Imagine a tetrahedron enscribed
 * into a cube so that 2 corners of the tetrahedron are in the opposite
 * 2 top corners of the cube and the other 2 corners of the tetrahedron
 * are in the other bottom 2 corners. This leaves 4 little irregular
 * tetrahedrons to complete the cube. 4 of those smaller tetrahedron
 * can be assembled into an octahedron.
 *
 * There are 2 possible orientations for this cube. The complete
 * space is filled with a checkerboard pattern of those 2 cubes.
 *
 * Each of these cubes is represented as one 3x3x3 cube in the normal
 * cube grid. The regular tetrahedron is the center cube and the 4
 * irregular tetrahedrons are represented by voxels in the corresponding
 * corners of the 3x3x3 cube
 *
 * To better unserstand this grid, it is best best is to play a bit
 * with it in the GUI.
