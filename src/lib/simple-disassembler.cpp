/* this is a breadth first search function that analyses the movement of

 * the parameters are:
 *  - pieces: defines which pieces of the assembly voxel space are actually really present
 *            in the current subproblem
 *  - start: the start position of each piece
 *
 * A lof of stuff happens automatically, e.g the disassemblerNode_c class is reference counted

  // those nodes around because we only need to keep them, when they could
  // be on a shortest path. That means we only keep the nodes, when they
  // lead to a node from the open list
  //
  // But we need to keep the nodes long enough to be sure we don't walk back
  // in our movement tree. So we organize the closed nodes in 3 fronts. All nodes
  // on each front have the same distance from the root node. old is one step less
  // than current which again is one step less than new front away from root
  //
  // when we start analysing a new front all nodes in the open list are also in the
  // current front. The new front is empty. now we take one node adfter the other from
  // the open list, analyze them. When the new found nodes are in oldfront, then they
  // are a step back towards root and can be dropped. When they are in the current
  // front, then they are a step sideways to another node with the same distance and
  // can be dropped, when the new node is in new front, it is a step away from the
  // root, but we already do know a way to that node and we can drop this node.
  // Only when the new node is unknown it is something interesting. We insert the
  // new node into the new front.
  //
  // That way we slowly empty the openList and build up a new open list with nodes
  // that we didn't know about before
  //
  // Once the current open list is empty, we have completely analyzed the current front
  // that means we don't need the old front any more because we can no longer reach those
  // nodes directly by analyzing a node from the open list because those nodes are now at
  // least 2 steps away, so we release them. The reference counting will make sure no longer
  // needed nodes will get freed.
  // The current front will becom the old front, the new front the current front and we
  // open up a new empty new front. The new built up open list will be used to get
  // the new nodes to analyze and an other open list will be started.
