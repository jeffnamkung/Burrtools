/** \page transformationDetails Transformations and Symmetries in BurrTools
 *
 * A transformation rotates and mirrors a shape inside its spacegrid. That means the
 * transformed shapes again resides completely within the grid. Transformations are
 * normally completely opaque to the user. They are simply a number that corresponds
 * to one posible rotation. Some things are rules though
 *
 * - The lower transformation numbers don't contains mirror transformations
 * - The upper transformations all contain a mirror
 *
 * BurrTools uses a concept that I call Symmetries. Throughout the sources the word
 * symmetry can mean either of 2 possible things:
 *
 * - A transformation that will reorient a shape onto itself
 * - or A list of all transformations that with the above property, sometimes refered to as symmetry group
 *
 * For each shape we can calculate such a list of transformations. There are some
 * things to keep in mind:
 *
 * - when you transform the shape the list may change. That is the symmetry list is not
 *   orientation independent
 * - BurrTools doesn't handle the list, but it knows all possible symmetry lists and has
 *   enumbered them and only uses those numbers wherever it is possible
