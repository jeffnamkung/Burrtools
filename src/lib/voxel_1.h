/**
 * Voxel class for the triangle grid.
 *
 * This grid is a bit more irregular then the others. It has in a way (depending
 * on how you look at it) either 2 different axes, or 4 axes, of which one is different.
 *
 * The grid is a stack of planes of tightly packed triangles. The grid in each plane is
 * identical. But on the plane you have 2 different triangles: one halve points up the
 * other halve points down.
 *
 * This means that you can move along the z-axis (the stacking direction) in one voxel
 * steps, but in teh other directions only in 2 voxel steps.
