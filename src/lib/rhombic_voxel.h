/**
 * Voxel class for the rhombic grid.
 *
 * This grid builds on top of the cube grid. The rhombic grid is emulated using
 * cubes. So this class uses many functions from the cubes voxel space.
 *
 * This class mainly adds alignment functionality for transformations
 * and the neighbor functionality.
 *
 * The rhombic grid emulation is explained in the user guide with some graphics,
 * here I can place only a textual description which might be hard to understand.
 *
 * It is possible to halve a cube in such a way that you get 2 prisms with a triangle
 * as base face. This triangle has a shape of an rectangular triangle with sides of
 * length 1, 1 and sqrt(2). There are 2*3 = 6 such cuts possible. If you do all those 6
 * cuts on a cube you get 24 little irregular but identical tetrahedras. Those are
 * the building blocks of the rhombic grid.
 *
 * The cube with its 24 tetrahedras is emulated in a 5x5x5 sized cube within the
 * cubic grid. The 24 tetrahedras are located as little diamonds on each of the six
 * faces of the 5x5x5 cube. That makes 6 faces with 4 cubes each = 24 voxels.
 *
 * Have a look at the user guide to see this and play with BurrTools to understand
 * the grid.
 *
 * With this grid it is possible to build rhombic dodecahedrons. The grid needs alignment
 * of 5 in each direction to ensure voxels don't change parity when the shape is rotated.
 * Also translations can only be done in multiples of 5 and so on...
