    // well, this is a slightly optimized version of the above idea,
    // it will save 2 of the cross products required, which is a lot
    // in case of triangles and quadrilaterals....
    //
    // The above idea uses the origin as the base point p0 for all of the cross
    // products, I use one point of the polygon, which makes 2 vectors 0 and
    // the crossproduct as well, so we leave those 2 out. As we simply use
    // the first point of the polygon as p0, so the first and last crossproduct are
    // 0 and are dropped
    //
    // finally because we now have a p0 within the plane of the polygon, we
    // don't need the scalarproduct with the normal vector, as now the crossproduct
    // will be parallel to n.
    //
    // So how does it work? Have a look at the wikipedia articles for polygon and crossproduct
    //
    // The basic idea is that the polygon is triangulated to one point and that the area
    // of the triangles is calculated and added up. The crossproduct calculates the are
    // of the parallellogram thus resulting in twice the size required, thus the
    // multiplication with 0.5 at the end
    //
    // The nice thing is that outside triangles, that are not insiede the polygon have
    // a negative area and are thus subtracted from the area of the real polygon.
